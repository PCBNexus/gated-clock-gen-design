Dummy primitive for feed-through
================================

This is a dummy primitive used to trick two routing columns into connecting to
each other. It's just two pins (`A` and `B`) at the same location with no
additional artwork.

This particular feedthrough has the feedthrough coordinate at the same location
as the A pin of a nand3/nand2.
