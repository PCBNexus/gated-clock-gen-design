Border
======

This subcircuit comprises the entire flipflop chain on the border of the clock.
The reference point is at the bottom of the clock, centered around the minutes
configuration circuit, with the local coordinate system such that positive Y is
clockwise. The local Y coordinate range is -500mm to 500mm for a full circle
(radius 159.15mm).
