PCB trace parameters:

    R = 0.00238 Ohm/mm
    L = 0.23 nH/mm
    C = 0.1462 pF/mm
    t = 5.72 ps/mm (if properly matched, which it isn't)

Gate parameters:

    Cin = 3 pF
    Rout = 17 Ohm ~ 37 Ohm
    tpd = 1 ns ~ 3.6 ns

Propagation time with loading:

    tpd_min = fanout * 192 + length * 366 + 1000 ps
    tpd_max = fanout * 252 + length * 480 + 3600 ps

Let's forget about all of this. Just add a series resistor and load capacitor
to each gate to get a more controlled propagation time. Furthermore, to ease
the hold timing constraint, just use a larger capacitor for the P4 gate of each
flipflop. 100R/330pF for the normal gates and 100R/2200pF seems to work with
pretty dire worst-case assumptions for everything else. Even then, the
flipflops still seem to work at 500kHz, with only 5.5mA dynamic power for the
slow gates and 0.826mA for the fast gates. A self-test at that frequency thus
runs at 10000x real-time, which is only 8.64s to go through a full day.
